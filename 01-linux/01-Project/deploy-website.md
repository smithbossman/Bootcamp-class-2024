 Step-by-step guide for deploying a web project from a GitHub repository to an Apache web server on Linux. 

### Step 1: Preparation

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**: Confirm that you have Git installed on your system to clone the repository. Also, ensure that you have Apache (or your preferred web server) installed and running on your Linux machine.

2. **Identify the Project Repository**: Locate the GitHub URL of the web project you wish to deploy. This URL is necessary for downloading the project files to your local machine. (git-repo)[https://github.com/emortoo/apache-httpd.git]

### Step 2: Download the Project

1. **Open a Terminal Window**: You'll need to use the terminal to execute the cloning process. Find and open your terminal application.

2. **Navigate to a Suitable Directory**: Choose a directory where you want to download the project files. This should be a workspace where you manage your projects.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the project from GitHub to your chosen directory. This action downloads all the project files to a new directory named after the project within your current location.

### Step 3: Deploy the Project Files

1. **Locate Apache's Web Root Directory**: Determine the root directory used by your Apache web server to serve web pages. This is commonly a specific path on your system where web files are stored and accessed by the server.

2. **Move the Project Files**: Transfer the cloned project files into Apache's web root directory. This step may require administrative privileges, as the web root directory is typically protected.

### Step 4: Configure File Permissions and Ownership

1. **Understand File Ownership**: Recognize that your web server runs as a specific user and group, commonly referred to as `www-data` or a similar default web server user. This user needs appropriate access to the project files to serve them to visitors.

2. **Adjust Ownership**: Change the ownership of the project files within the web root directory to match the web server's user and group. This ensures that the server can read and serve the files correctly.

3. **Verify Permissions**: Make sure the file permissions are set correctly for the web server to access and serve the project files. The files should be readable by the web server user, at a minimum.

### Step 5: Finalize Deployment

1. **Restart the Web Server**: After moving the files and setting the correct permissions, you may need to restart the web server to apply the changes and recognize the new files.

2. **Test the Deployment**: Open a web browser and navigate to your server's domain or IP address to verify that the project is being served correctly. Check for any errors and ensure that the website loads as expected.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can deploy a web project from a GitHub repository to an Apache web server, ensuring the proper setup of file permissions and ownership for secure and correct operation. 
This process involves preparing your environment, downloading the project files, configuring the server environment, and verifying the deployment.
