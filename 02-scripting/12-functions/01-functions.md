In Bash scripting, a function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific task. Functions help you organize your script better, make it more readable, and reduce code duplication. A function in Bash is defined using the following syntax:

```bash
function_name() {
  # Code to execute
  command1
  command2
  ...
}
```

Or you can use the `function` keyword:

```bash
function function_name {
  # Code to execute
  command1
  command2
  ...
}
```

Both forms are equivalent, but the first one is more commonly used and preferred for consistency with other programming languages.

### Calling a Function

After defining a function, you can call it by simply using its name anywhere in your script after its definition:

```bash
function_name
```

### Passing Arguments to Functions

You can pass arguments to functions similar to how you pass arguments to scripts. Inside the function, arguments are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$N`, where `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second argument, etc. `$#` gives you the number of arguments.

```bash
function greet {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "World"  # Prints "Hello, World!"
```

### Return Values

In Bash, a function returns a status code (not values like in other programming languages). The status code `0` usually signifies success, while any other code signifies an error. You can use the `return` command to exit a function with a specific status code.

```bash
function check_file {
  if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "$1 exists."
    return 0  # Success
  else
    echo "$1 does not exist."
    return 1  # Error
  fi
}
```

To capture the return value of a function, use the special variable `$?` immediately after calling the function:

```bash
check_file "/path/to/file"
echo "Return status: $?"
```

### Local Variables

By default, variables in functions are global. To create a variable that is local to the function, use the `local` keyword:

```bash
function set_var {
  local local_var="I am local"
  global_var="I am global"
}

set_var
echo $local_var  # Will not print anything because local_var is not accessible here
echo $global_var # Will print "I am global"
```

Functions are a fundamental building block in Bash scripting that enhance the modularity, reusability, and readability of your code.
