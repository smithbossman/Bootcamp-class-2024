Absolutely! Let's create a beginner-level script that prints out the current date and time, including a comment to explain what the script does.

### Step 1: Open `vi` Text Editor
Start by opening your terminal and typing the following:

```bash
vi show_date.sh
```

This command opens `vi` and creates a new file named `show_date.sh`.

### Step 2: Enter Insert Mode
Press `i` to switch to insert mode in `vi`, which allows you to start typing your script.

### Step 3: Write the Shebang Line
Type the shebang line at the top of the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

### Step 4: Add a Comment
Now, let's add a comment that describes what the script does:

```bash
# This script displays the current date and time.
```

### Step 5: Write the Command to Show Date and Time
On the next line, type the command to output the current date and time:

```bash
date
```

Your `vi` editor should now look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script displays the current date and time.
date
```

### Step 6: Save and Exit
To save and exit `vi`:

1. Press `Esc` to leave insert mode and return to normal mode.
2. Type `:wq` to write the changes to the file and quit `vi`.

### Step 7: Make the Script Executable
Change the script's permissions to make it executable with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x show_date.sh
```

### Step 8: Run the Script
You can now run the script by entering:

```bash
./show_date.sh
```

This will display the current date and time in your terminal. Remember that the `date` command will output the date and time according to the system's timezone configuration.
