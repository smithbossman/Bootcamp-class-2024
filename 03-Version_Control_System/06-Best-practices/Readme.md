### Module 6: Best Practices and Additional Tools

In this module, we'll discuss best practices for working with Git and GitHub, introduce some tools and shortcuts that can help streamline your workflow, and provide an overview of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

#### Commit Messages Best Practices

- **Convey Intent Clearly**: Write commit messages that clearly explain what the commit does and why. The first line should be a concise summary, followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary.
- **Use the Imperative Mood**: Start the commit message with an imperative verb, like "Add", "Remove", "Update", or "Fix".
- **Keep the First Line Short**: Aim for about 50 characters for the summary. If you need more detail, follow the summary with a blank line and then a more thorough description.
- **Reference Issues and Pull Requests**: If the commit is related to an issue or a pull request, include the reference number in the commit message.

#### Git Aliases and Shortcuts

- **Creating Aliases**: You can create aliases for common Git commands to save time. For example, `git config --global alias.co checkout` will allow you to use `git co` as a shortcut for `git checkout`.
- **Common Aliases**: Set up aliases for your most-used commands. Examples include `st` for `status`, `br` for `branch`, `cm` for `commit`, or `lg` for a customized log output.
  
#### Introduction to Graphical Git Clients

- **GUI Clients**: There are many Git clients with graphical interfaces that can make it easier to handle complex Git tasks. Some popular clients include GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, GitKraken, and TortoiseGit.
- **Visualization and History**: Graphical clients often provide visual representations of commit histories, branch structures, and merging conflicts, which can help you understand the state of your repository at a glance.
